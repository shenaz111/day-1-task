http  
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web
 applications. More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to
 request and send information.

The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through 
several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 
This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called
 HTTP/2 was created.
